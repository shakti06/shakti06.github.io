            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>
                I am a recently graduated student from Charles Strut University specializing in data Science.
                 I have some experience in developing the software products using the different front-end and back-end Javascript libaries and am open to full-time position.
                 I am interested in pursuing my carrer in software engineering. 
                <br>
                <br>
                 I have completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Tribhuvan University.My undergraduate project was based on the sentiment analysis of the customer feedback using the machine learning algorithms mainly naive bays.I have also worked as the software engineer trainee to develop the ecommerce  site using the node js.

           <small>
            The project was based on the prediction of COVID-19 using the machine learning algorithms mainly Neural network,Support Vector Machines and Naive bays.
            The detail analysis was done and results were compared visually.Visualizations were done to show the death,recovered cases.

           <small>
            The sentiment analysis was done on the customer feedback using the machine learning algorithm Naive Bays.It generates the rating based upon
            the given customer feedback.The project was developed for the ecommerce platform where the review on the items can be generated.
